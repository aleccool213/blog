The typical situation goes as follows: 

* Coworker comes to my desk to ask me a question
* Sees something radical happening on screen
* Asks why they haven't heard of the application
* Screams silently

    <tr><td><img src="./screams3.gif" alt="porg-screaming"/></td></tr>
</table>

In lue of this, many people are unaware of some nifty Mac applications which will make your productively skyrocket. I thought to put a collection of my top-rated apps which follow a loose criteria:

* must look amazing
* ‚Äémust have great keyboard shortcuts
* must be hipster AF

People will complain that most of these apps function as terminal command wrappers but my brain works better with visual representations of things. Most are developer-centric but could be used by anyone.

Here we go:

## Alfred

### Overview

Ever want to create custom commands in MacOS Spotlight? With Alfred you can do that and more. Create highly customizable commands easily and also being able to get them from the community. Spotify, Todoist, and GitHub are just some of the example integrations which make performing actions always a single key stroke compared to a few key strokes.

</table>


### Opinion

Absolutely essential. I don't know how I used my Mac before this. Makes something developers have been doing for years when it comes to alias/functions and makes it accessible to the masses. Saves me a ton of time each day and I see myself this using everyday until kingdom-come.

## ‚ÄéSpectacle

### Overview

Open source implementation of a MacOS window manager. Great default keyboard shortcuts which are all customizable. Double-click like shortcuts which let you manage proportions more easily than how other apps perform.

</table>

### Opinion

Everyone needs a window manager and I love this one because it doesn't try to do too much. It has one job and does that one well. Very small and performant which makes this app easy to recommend to anyone.

### Part 2

I will be making a part 2 to this series which focuses more on developer-centric apps.
